    <div class="section-info container">
        <h2 class="section-buzz">Our program is comprised of <span>passionate students</span> committed to improving lives abroad through <span>creative</span> and <span>sustainable</span> engineering <span>solutions</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders aims to address the problems facing people both locally and overseas by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the sponsorships formed with our organization.  Our members come from many different arts, sciences, and engineering backgrounds, but share the desire to do meaningful work and make a difference.</p>
            <p>The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, Uganda, and Morocco.  The <a href="http://cuewb.org/ghana.html" target="_blank">Ghana program</a>, which started in 2004, used to work in the semi-urban town of Sakyikrom but now focuses on water management in the farming community of Obodan.  In 2008, the <a href="http://cuewb.org/uganda.html" target="_blank">Uganda program</a> was established to install a Multi-Function Energy Platform in the Soroti region.  The Morocco program, which began in 2011, finished building a <a href="#bridge">bridge</a> in the rural community of Ait Bayoud in June 2013 and is now planning a future <a href="#water">water project</a> in the nearby community of Izguaren.  Each project draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle"><span>Ait Bayoud</span>, a rural Moroccan community in the Essaouira region, experiences <span>seasonal flooding</span> of its central Tagawowt river that <span>disrupts access</span> to the local <span>health clinic</span>, <span>school</span>, and <span>markets</span> for hundreds of residents.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">The <span>Morocco program</span> of Columbia's EWB-USA chapter began in 2011 when Nina Morency-Brassard, a Columbia alumna and Peace Corps volunteer stationed in Ait Bayoud, reached out to our chapter with a collaborative <span>project proposal</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>To address the flooding of the Tagawowt river, the community suggested a bridge project to EWB-USA CU so that the river could be safely and consistently crossed during the rainy season.  Along with professional structural engineers, various Peace Corps volunteers, and a host of community leaders and workers in Ait Bayoud, the students of the Morocco project have worked to fund, design, and source materials for the implementation of a 210ft suspension footbridge.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2011 and the winter of 2012, two assessment teams gathered technical data and determined a bridge site. In the summer of 2012, implementation of the bridge began.  Over the course of 6 weeks, our team of students and professional mentors worked alongside local workers in Ait Bayoud to clear and prepare the bridge sites, mix and pour the concrete foundations and towers, and install each of the bridge's main cables.  In January 2013, we sent a team to assess the current state of the bridge and ensure that the work done so far has been maintained.  Last June, we sent two final project teams to tension the bridge cables, install decking, and complete the project.  In the future, we plan to teach the community how to maintain the bridge without our help and hope to eventually build a second bridge at another site.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">The members of <span>Izguaren</span>, one of a series of dwars or neighborhood clusters that make up Ait Bayoud, spend up to <span>4 hours a day</span> walking <span>to get water</span>.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">While assessing the community of Ait Bayoud during her Peace Corps Service, Nina noticed another <span>pressing issue</span> to the <span>quality of life</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>Ait Bayoud consists of a series of dwars, or neighborhood clusters, that are staggered along the river.  Although most of the dwars have ready access to the main necessities of life, Izguaren, a dwar isolated on a raised plateau, suffers from limited access to water.  Everyday, families walk back and forth down to the river to gather water from a nearby spring, spending about an hour per trip and making up to 3 trips a day.  To address this issue, we sent a group of students and a US Army Corps Engineer experienced in water projects to Izguaren during our assessment trip in winter 2013.  There, the team learned about the dwar's needs, the river conditions, and Ait Bayoud's current water sourcing status.  Based on their assessment, the Morocco program has decided to pursue a water sourcing project in Ait Bayoud and will perform further tests and assessment in upcoming trips.</p>
