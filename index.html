			<p>The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders aims to address the problems facing people both locally and overseas by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the partnerships formed with our organization.  Our members come from many different arts, sciences, and engineering backgrounds, but share the desire to do meaningful work while constantly from each other.</p>
			<p>The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, Uganda, and Morocco.  The Ghana program, which started in 2004, used to work in the semi-urban town of Sakyikrom but now focuses on water management in the farming community of Obodan.  In 2008, the Uganda program was established to install a Multi-Function Energy Platform in the Soroti region.  The Morocco program, which began in 2011, finished building a bridge in the rural community of Ait Bayoud in June 2013 and is now planning a future water project in the nearby community of Ilz-Ghoren(sp?).  Each project draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems.
