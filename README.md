EWB-Morocco
===========

The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) aims to 
address the problems facing people both locally and abroad by leveraging the 
skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the 
partnerships formed with our organization.  Our members come from many 
different engineering and arts backgrounds, sharing the desire to do 
meaningful work in improving the lives of others through creative and 
sustainable engineering solutions.

About This Project
------------------

The Columbia University chapter of EWB is comprised of 3 programs: Ghana, 
Uganda, and Morocco.  For a long time the three shared a 
[single website][homepage], designed by a member of the Public Relations team 
of the Morocco program.  However, sharing a site severely limits the freedom 
of design for each individual program.  The Morocco program decided to 
redesign its website for a more streamlined, user-friendly feel and this 
repository holds all the files that, after being updated and reviewed, get 
synced to our main FTP server.

The current website of Columbia University's EWB-Morocco program can be found 
[here][morocco site].
