EWB-Morocco
===========

The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) aims to address the problems facing people both locally and abroad by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the partnerships formed with our organization.  Our members come from all engineering and arts backgrounds, sharing the desire to do meaningful work in improving the lives of others through creative and sustainable engineering solutions.

About This Project
------------------

The Columbia University chapter of EWB is comprised of 3 programs: Ghana, Uganda, and Morocco.  For a long time the three have shared a [single website][homepage], designed by a member of the Public Relations team of the Morocco program.  However, sharing a site severely limits the freedom of design for each individual program.  The Morocco program has decided to redesign its website for a more streamlined, user-friendly feel and this repository will hold all files that contribute to the new face of EWB Morocco.

The current website of Columbia University's EWB-Morocco program can be found [here][morocco site].
